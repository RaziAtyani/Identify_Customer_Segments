# Unsupervised Learning Project: Customer Segmentation for a Mail-Order Company

## Project Overview

In this project, you will work with real-life data provided by our Bertelsmann partners, **AZ Direct** and **Arvato Finance Solution**. The dataset concerns a German mail-order sales company. The key objective is to identify segments of the population that are most likely to purchase the company's products, aiding in the optimization of a future mailout campaign.

As a data scientist, your role will be to:
- Apply **unsupervised learning** techniques to organize the general population into clusters.
- Use these clusters to determine which groups form the core user base.
- Preprocess and clean the dataset to ensure it is in a usable form before applying machine learning methods.

## Installation Requirements

It is **highly recommended** that you use the provided project workspace to complete and submit your project.

> **Important**: If you download and use the data locally, you must delete it after completion in accordance with the agreement with Arvato Bertelsmann.

If you choose to work on your local machine, ensure the following software and libraries are installed:

### Python Environment
- **Python 3** (via [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/) is recommended)

### Required Libraries
- `NumPy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`

You will also need **Jupyter Notebooks** as your development environment.

## Why This Project?

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- **Unsupervised Learning Skills**:
  - Learn how to cluster complex datasets and interpret the results.
  - Gain experience with dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to surface signal and patterns.
- **Data Wrangling and Preprocessing**:
  - Practice the essential skill of cleaning and preparing real-world, messy data.
  - Make critical decisions about missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.

Unsupervised learning is a powerful tool when objective labels or outcomes are not available. Clustering can help uncover hidden groupings in the data, while dimensionality reduction can simplify complex datasets into more interpretable forms. This project will simulate a real-world workflow that precedes and complements supervised learning applications.

## Summary

By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:
- Preparing data for machine learning.
- Using clustering to segment customers.
- Interpreting cluster results to support business decision-making.

These are vital skills for any data science professional working with real-world data in commercial settings.
